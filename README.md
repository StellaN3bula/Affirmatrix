# Affirmatrix – Your Personal Affirmation Generator 🌟 
Ever had a rough day? Negative thoughts creeping in? No worries – **Affirmatrix ** has got your back! 
Enter Y and get a **random positive affirmation** to brighten your mood. 

## 💡 Inspiration  

This project was born from a real-life moment. On **22.02.2025**, I had a rough day, and a friend told me:  
*"Turn your negative thoughts into positive ones!"*  

That sparked an idea:  
Why not create a simple program where you **just press a button** (or in this case, type 'Y'), and get an **instant positive affirmation**?  

That same evening, **Affirmatrix** was born. 🚀
